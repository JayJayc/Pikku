Prices are ok, but not for beer. Service was mostly good, but they brought the orders out separately instead of at the same time, with a ten minute gap between. We were sat near the front and beside the serving station so it was too busy and noisy (didn’t offer us a quiet seat even tho there were plenty available). Washrooms and hallways kind of messy. Seats were very uncomfortable. Overall: good food, friendly service, but restaurant could use some upkeep.",
